Inversion Research Project

"In times of war and peace, the wrens still build their nests."

1 - Objectives

1.1 - Angle-dependent PP and PS Reflectivity

* Reproduce published refletivity curves
  (P-wave angle of incidence X Rpp, Rps)

1.2 - Synthetic seismogram

Characteristics:
* Convolutional model
* Zoepprittz equation or good approximation (ex: Fatti)
* Angle gather stacks
* PP and PS

Inputs:
* Vp, Vs and Ro (Density) logs
